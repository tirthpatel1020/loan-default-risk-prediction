MODEL DEVELOPMENT & EVALUATION SUMMARY
=======================================

MODELS TRAINED:
---------------
1. Logistic Regression (Baseline) - Traditional features only
2. Logistic Regression (Enhanced) - All features
3. Random Forest - All features
4. XGBoost - All features
5. Neural Network - All features

BEST PERFORMING MODEL:
----------------------
Model: Logistic Regression (Enhanced)
ROC-AUC: 0.9943
F1-Score: 0.9190
Accuracy: 0.9663

CYBERSECURITY FEATURE IMPACT:
------------------------------
ROC-AUC Improvement: 36.38%
F1-Score Improvement: 104.92%
Recall Improvement: 50.00%

KEY FINDINGS:
-------------
1. Cybersecurity features improve model performance
2. Enhanced model outperforms baseline
3. Tree-based models (RF/XGB) capture feature interactions well
4. All models exceed random baseline (50% AUC)
