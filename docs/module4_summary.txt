MODEL EXPLAINABILITY & ANALYSIS SUMMARY
========================================

1. FEATURE IMPORTANCE ANALYSIS
   ---------------------------
   Top 5 Features (Random Forest):
                     Feature  RF_Importance          Type
   info_consistency_score      44.146068 Cybersecurity
           app_edit_score      22.781891 Cybersecurity
behavioral_risk_composite       9.639123 Cybersecurity
            grade_encoded       5.096472   Traditional
                 int_rate       3.630557   Traditional
   
   Cybersecurity vs Traditional:
   - Cybersecurity features: 71.29% of total importance
   - Traditional features: 28.71% of total importance

2. MODEL INTERPRETABILITY
   -----------------------
   - Logistic Regression coefficients analyzed
   - SHAP values computed for tree models
   - Individual predictions explained
   - Feature interactions identified

3. BUSINESS INSIGHTS
   ------------------
   Key Behavioral Indicators:
   - info_consistency_score: Primary risk indicator
   - app_edit_score: Second most important
   - behavioral_risk_composite: Aggregates all signals
   
   Recommended Actions:
   - Flag low consistency scores for review
   - Verify applications with 5+ edits
   - Require MFA for irregular login patterns
   - Enhanced verification for device anomalies

4. RISK SCORING SYSTEM
   --------------------
   Risk Categories:
   Low Risk    17579
   
   Default Rates:
                 Actual_Default              
                       count   sum    mean
Risk_Category                             
Low Risk               17579  3521  0.2003
